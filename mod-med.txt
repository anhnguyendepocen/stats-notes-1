Moderation
==========

Let X be predictor, Y response and Z moderator.

Fit model Y ~ X + Z + XZ.

The coefficient on XZ measures the moderation effect.



Mediation
=========
http://davidakenny.net/cm/mediate.htm

Let X be predictor, Y response and Z moderator.

Unmediated model is

       c
X ----------> Y

Model is

      M
  a -   - b
  -   d   ->
X ----------> Y

Step 1: Y ~ cX. Predictor is correlated with outcome.
Step 2: M ~ aX. Moderator is correlated with predictor.
Step 3: Y ~ dX + bM. Mediator affects the outcome variable. Does more than step 1 because it controls for predictor.

Now, if c, a and b are significant, we've shown partial mediation.

If additionally, d **is** 0, then we've shown complete mediation.

Total effect = direct effect + indirect effect
c = d + a*b
