margins
---------

Average predicted value in data.

margins <cat>
---------

Average predicted value in data if everyone in the data had the same
level of <cat>. (Functionally equivalent to <cat> <- 1; predict(),
etc)

margins, atmeans
---------

Predicted value for an observation with the mean value of each
predictor.

margins <cat>, atmeans
---------

Predicted value for an observation having each level of the
categorical, and the mean value for every other predictor. (Same
results as `margins, at(<cat> = (<levels of cat>)) atmeans`.)

margins, at(<cont> = <numlist>)
---------

Average predicte value in data if everyone in the data had the same
value of <cont>. (Functionally equivalent to <cont> <- <numlist>;
predict(), etc)

margins <cat1>#<cat2>
---------

Same as `margins <cat>` except at every combination between <cat1> and
<cat2>.
